            <p>Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT) is a complete language, but
                hardly a general-purpose one. Despite this, it has been shoehorned into doing some
                spectacular things, some of them useless, and some of them not. This paper presents
                Naxos, an XSLT 1.0 processor itself written in XSLT 1.0. </p>

            <h2 class="topictitle2">Origins of XSL</h2>

            <div>
            <p>The Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) came about once everyone realized that
                Cascading Stylesheets (CSS)<a name="fnsrc_1" href="#fntarg_1"><sup>1</sup></a> were never going to
                have the expressiveness required for traditional paged output. Pages introduce
                fiddly logic with respect to widows and orphans, running headers and footers, and
                floating figures. Sometimes it is necessary to repeat (in the case of chapter titles
                in headers) or reorder (in the case of a figure that is out of the document flow)
                text. CSS does not provide these kinds of operations.</p>

            <p>A pioneering alternative to CSS, popular in the SGML world, is the Document Style
                Semantics and Specification Language (DSSSL)<a name="fnsrc_2" href="#fntarg_2"><sup>2</sup></a>. This
                Scheme-like language has features such as conditional processing to allow the
                processor to make the run-time decisions necessary for paged output. Nowadays,
                DSSSL, like SGML, is mostly a historical footnote.</p>

            <p>With the rising popularity of XML, and lessons learned from CSS and DSSSL, came XSL.
                Like CSS, XSL uses a simple box model to represent block and inline elements. Like
                DSSSL, XSL has programming-like capabilities to defer formatting decisions to
                runtime. Unlike both, XSL is itself written in XML, a recognition of the fact that
                XML is also a general-purpose language for representing any tree-like structure.</p>

            <p>Cleverly, XSL separates the formatting-specific directives (Formatting
                    Objects<a name="fnsrc_3" href="#fntarg_3"><sup>3</sup></a>) from the general-purpose
                tree-manipulation directives (Transformations<a name="fnsrc_4" href="#fntarg_4"><sup>4</sup></a>).
                The latter turned out to be useful in the larger domain of converting XML documents
                into other XML documents. Consequently, stylesheets written using XSL
                Transformations, or XSLT, find use in situations unrelated to formatting print
                output.</p>

            <p>XSLT has the ability to perform both repetition (loops) and selection (if-else), and
                is in fact a Turing-Complete language<a name="fnsrc_5" href="#fntarg_5"><sup>5</sup></a>. This means that it is capable of
                expressing any construct possible in other programming languages, albeit not quite
                so compactly.</p>

        </div>

        </div>
        
        <div class="nested1" id="x2"><a name="x2"><!-- --></a>
            <h2 class="topictitle2">Why XSLT is different</h2>

            <div>
            <p> Compared with traditional programming languages, XSLT is somewhat alien. These
                differences stem from deliberate decisions intended to allow processors to run as
                efficiently as possible, predominantly through restricting the side-effects that
                XSLT templates are able to have. For instance, XSLT does not have variables in the
                usual sense. Variables must be given a value when they are declared, and there is no
                way to change that value later. </p>

            <p> XSLT also doesn't have loops in the normal sense of the word. Without mutable
                variables, iteration has to be done in terms of recursion. This is familiar to
                programmers of stack-based languages like Forth or functional languages like
                Haskell. (There is a <strong>for-each</strong> element in XSLT, but this is more of a
                parallel-processing directive, since the iterations cannot communicate with each
                other.) </p>

            <p> These seeming shortcomings are a deliberate design decision in XSLT. Without
                side-effects, it becomes possible for processors to cache results from earlier calls
                to templates with the same parameters. Additionally, processing can be more easily
                parallelized and performed out of order when needed. It could almost be considered
                wasteful for an XSLT processor to not be multi-threaded.</p>

        </div>

        </div>
        
        <div class="nested1" id="x3"><a name="x3"><!-- --></a>
            <h2 class="topictitle2">Recursive recursion</h2>

            <div>
            <p>Most real-world XSLT stylesheets are unambitious in the scope of XML documents that
                they manipulate. They may operate only on XML documents with a simple content model,
                and usually the stylesheet has a specific, single purpose.  This is unfortunate,
                because XSLT is capable of being used for more general-purpose programming.</p>

            <p>To that end, I present Naxos.
               Naxos is an XSLT 1.0 processor, itself written in XSLT 1.0. It makes use of no
                    EXSLT<a name="fnsrc_6" href="#fntarg_6"><sup>6</sup></a> functions (in particular, <strong>node-set()</strong>
                is avoided) and so should run correctly on any XSLT processor.</p>

            <p>Naxos is made possible by the fact that XSLT stylesheets are themselves written in
                XML, and hence able to be processed by another stylesheet. This has been used to
                good end for stylesheet preprocessors, which turn stylesheets containing extensions
                into vanilla XSLT<a name="fnsrc_7" href="#fntarg_7"><sup>7</sup></a>. It has also been used
                for more pointless endeavours<a name="fnsrc_8" href="#fntarg_8"><sup>8</sup></a>.</p>

            <div class="p">Ideally, an interpreter for its own language should boil down to variations on
                <pre>function_plus(a, b)
{
  return eval(a) + eval(b);
}</pre>

                but this is made difficult in the case of XSLT by some holes in XSLT's introspection
                capabilities. These came in four main flavours. </div>

            <div class="section"><h3 class="sectiontitle">XPath</h3>
                
                <p> Although XSLT is pure XML, it makes use of an embedded sub-language called
                        XPath<a name="fnsrc_9" href="#fntarg_9"><sup>9</sup></a>. XPath is a traditional token-based
                    language used by XSLT to select nodes for templates, to match templates and to
                    generate the result tree. An XPath expression such as
                        <samp class="codeph">/html/body/*[@class='foo']</samp> must be tokenized and built into
                    an expression tree before evaluation. XPath itself contains string operations,
                    but they are not optimized for tokenization, so some low-level routines had to
                    be written to provide these operations.</p>

                <div class="p">Building the XPath expression tree was achieved by writing a recursive-descent
                    parser in XSLT. This parser processes a grammar expressed in XML, invoking
                    recursively productions which match as it walks along the expression string. An
                    example of such a rule is the one for a PrimaryExpr, which is an atomic
                    expression that produces a value:
                    <pre>&lt;PrimaryExpr:rule&gt;
    &lt;sequence name="Variable"&gt;
        &lt;nonterminal name="VariableReference"/&gt;
    &lt;/sequence&gt;
    &lt;sequence name="ExprInParentheses"&gt;
        &lt;literal value="("/&gt;
        &lt;nonterminal name="Expr"/&gt;
        &lt;literal value=")"/&gt;
    &lt;/sequence&gt;
    &lt;sequence name="Literal"&gt;
        &lt;nonterminal name="Literal"/&gt;
    &lt;/sequence&gt;
    &lt;sequence name="Number"&gt;
        &lt;nonterminal name="Number"/&gt;
    &lt;/sequence&gt;
    &lt;sequence name="FunctionCall"&gt;
        &lt;nonterminal name="FunctionCall"/&gt;
    &lt;/sequence&gt;
&lt;/PrimaryExpr:rule&gt;</pre>

                    The use of namespaces for the rule name enable it to be embedded into the same
                    XSLT stylesheet as the template which interprets the expression tree, in true
                    yacc style.</div>

                <p>The XPath parser was affected in a more serious way by the following limitation
                    of XSLT.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="section"><h3 class="sectiontitle">Result tree fragments are not node sets</h3>
                
                <div class="p">XPath defines three atomic data types: number, string, boolean. It also defines
                    the node set, which is an unordered list of nodes from the document. While a
                    node set remains within the boundaries of XPath, it remains a node set. However,
                    XSLT 1.0 cannot create a node set; in particular, a template cannot return a
                    node set. Instead, a template such as
                    <pre>&lt;xsl:template name="make-foo-bar-text"&gt;
    &lt;foo&gt;
        &lt;bar/&gt;
        text
    &lt;/foo&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;
</pre>

                    returns a result tree fragment. Result tree fragments can be used only as part
                    of larger result tree fragments, or converted to strings. There is no way to
                    have make-foo-bar-text return a node set.</div>

                <div class="p">As a result, all of the XPath parsing routines pass serialized strings for the
                    expression tree. The above example would instead be written as
                    <pre>&lt;xsl:template name="make-foo-bar-text"&gt;
    &lt;xsl:value-of select="foo:bar;text"&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;
</pre>

                    Naturally, if any of the values themselves contain the delimiters <span class="q">":"</span> or
                        <span class="q">";"</span> then they have to be encoded. Naxos has a rudimentary URL-style
                    encoder/decoder for this purpose.</div>

                <p>Similar serialization applies to expression result values. Since a value does not
                    know what type it is, all values (number, string, boolean, node set, result tree
                    fragment) are serialized into strings with a prefix tagging their type.
                    Fortunately, there are few places where XSLT cares about the type of a
                variable.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="section"><h3 class="sectiontitle">Passing context</h3>
                
                <div class="p">Although XSLT has very little context, this is not the same as no context. Any
                    XPath expression and XSLT template has access to some out-of-band data,
                    including: <ul>
                        <li>The list of variables and their bound values.</li>

                        <li>The context node, the node which is <span class="q">"this"</span> node.</li>

                        <li>The context position, the position within the set of peer nodes that
                            this node occupies.</li>

                        <li>The set of namespace definitions in effect.</li>

                    </ul>
 This information has to be passed to each template in Naxos as it
                    interprets the expression tree and executes templates. In the case where an
                    element updates the context, this new context has to be propagated to all of the
                    remaining templates. Naxos uses a rudimentary hash datatype, serialized into a
                    string, to store the context. In the case of the document root and stylesheet
                    root, both node-sets which cannot be serialized nondestructively, these are
                    passed separately.</div>

            </div>

            <div class="section"><h3 class="sectiontitle">No computed gosub</h3>
                
                <div class="p">XSLT is not a functional language, so it is not possible to pass a function to a
                    template. Doing this would have been helpful for the recursive-descent parser to
                    chain processing of non-terminals. It isn't even possible to pass a template
                    name in a template call:
                    <pre>&lt;xsl:call-template name="{$template-name}"/&gt;</pre>
</div>

                <div class="p"> However, it <em>is</em> possible to dynamically call a template using
                    apply-templates:
                    <pre>&lt;xsl:apply-templates select="$template-nodeset"/&gt;</pre>

                    The trick is to ensure that $template-nodeset contains exactly one node, so that
                    the template which matches it is called exactly once. This is usually
                    accomplished by creating a dummy element in a unique namespace:
                    <pre>&lt;xsl:template match="*[namespace-uri()='http://futzle.com/2006/xslt-grammar/PrimaryExpr']"&gt;
    &lt;!-- ... --&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;
</pre>

                    The above template will match any element in the declared PrimaryExpr namespace,
                    which Naxos has only one instance of.<a name="fnsrc_10" href="#fntarg_10"><sup>10</sup></a></div>

                <p>This approach is also used by Naxos in the cases where a template has to
                    deserialize a node set in order to apply an XPath function to it. Since a
                    template cannot return a node set, Naxos passes a callback template to a generic
                    node-set deserialization template, which calls the callback template with the
                    node set.</p>

            <div>
            <p>Naxos is invoked by executing the naxos.xsl stylesheet on the source document. Naxos
                locates the stylesheet to interpret by examining the <strong>xml-stylesheet</strong>
                processing instruction in the source document.</p>

            <p>Naxos first scans the stylesheet, generating a list of known templates, their match
                patterns and priorities. Any XPath expressions in template patterns are precompiled and kept in a hash
                table. Naxos then applies the template which matches the root node of the source
                document, which may invoke other templates in turn. The output is delivered to
                standard output.</p>

            <div>
            <p>Naxos is optimized for correctness, not speed.  Several algorithms in it are polynomial time complexity.</p>

            <div class="section"><h3 class="sectiontitle">XPath parser</h3>
                
                <p>Naxos' XPath parser is a recursive-descent parser. Recursive-descent parsers do
                    not benefit much from a separate tokenization phase and support backtracking in
                    the case of dead-end productions. For a near-stateless language like XSLT, a
                    recursive-descent parser is a logical choice.</p>

                <p>However, recursive-descent parsers are notoriously slow and require careful
                    refactoring of the grammar to avoid infinite recursion. A lookahead parser would
                    doubtless run more quickly but would not be so clean to write.</p>

                <p>Naxos' recursive-descent parser is quite generic and could be adapted without
                    much effort to parse any other grammar.</p>

                <p>Naxos is comparatively faster at evaluating an expression tree. The XPath grammar
                    is specified well enough that evaluation seldom needs to go through redundant
                    stages, and backtracking is unnecessary. The largest overhead is likely of encoding and decoding the serialized
                    XPath expressions produced by the parser.  The following table shows some evaluation times on a Core Duo 1.83 MHz processor.</p>

                <p>Each stylesheet template declaration incurs a compilation overhead as its XPath patterns are parsed and serialized.
                    Similarly, global variables are parsed and evaluated, once, before templates are applied to the root node.  These template patterns
                    and variable values are retained as part of the global context for subsequent template application.
                </p>

                <p>Choosing the template to apply to a node requires testing each templates in the stylesheet on the source document node and
                on all its ancestors.  The serialization and deserialization of result tree fragments depends on the depth of the result tree.
                    Together, this results in polynomial-time evaluation for any XML source document.</p>

            <div class="p">XSLT 1.0 as a standard is now seven years old, and XSLT 2.0 is (as of 2006) close to becoming an official W3C recommendation.  There
                are already XSLT 2.0 processors available<a name="fnsrc_11" href="#fntarg_11"><sup>11</sup></a>.  XSLT 2.0 (and XPath 2.0) contain
                a more complete introspection model, solving almost every problem in XSLT 1.0 that Naxos had to create workarounds for:
            <ul>
                <li>Tokenization functions in XPath 2.0 allow regular expression matching on strings, simplifying parsing.</li>

                <li>Node sets and result tree fragments both become sequences in XSLT 2.0 and are interchangeable.</li>

                <li>Tunnel parameters obviate the need to name parameters which pass through a template unchanged.</li>

                <li>Templates can be called from within XPath 2.0 expressions.</li>

            </ul>

            Of course, XSLT 2.0 introduces many more functions and elements, so an XSLT 2.0 version of Naxos would likely be almost as big.
            </div>

            <p>Naxos began as a self dare, and quickly became a monster.  The XSLT parser and interpreter alone are 7500 lines of code.
            But it has helped to give me an appreciation for XSLT that mere daily use would not have done.</p>
