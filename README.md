# naxos
Naxos is an XSLT 1.0 processor written in XSLT 1.0

This processor demonstrates concepts I raised in a paper I wrote for the Open Source Developers' Conference 2006.

See <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/futzle/naxos/blob/master/DoingStupidThingsWithXSLT.html">the original paper</a> (HTML format) for detailed discussion.
